				Sacha is a designer, developer, and entrepreneur. After suffering through many years (ok, just three) of computer science classes, he decided his true calling was design and parlayed a love of textfields and checkboxes into a mildly successful career as a freelance UI designer. Lately though, he's been thinking this coding thing might have some legs after all, and spends his time on various open-source projects such as Vulcan. He's also the creator of Sidebar, a daily newsletter of design links.
