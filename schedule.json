None of them is either legacy or a silver bullet - a good dev needs to pick the right tool for the job. However, in order to understand them, we must step back to fundamentals all these rely on: the mechanics of event loop and run to completion rule, as well as learn to distinguish between sync and async flow. Then we proceed to design patterns built on top of each of the 5 approaches, discussing their strengths and limitations. Funfacts, such as famous Promise.race() included!",

Using GraphQL, a client can declaratively describe the data that it needs, and the GraphQL server will return exactly that data in a predictable shape. GraphQL Subscriptions, recently added to the open-source GraphQL spec, provides a way for clients to subscribe to real-time updates. Facebook has been using GraphQL in production for over five years and GraphQL Subscriptions in production for over two years. In this talk, we will start with an introduction to GraphQL and GraphQL Subscriptions. We will then discuss various lessons that our team has learned from operating these systems in production at Facebook. We’ll share some best practices for building out a GraphQL schema in a scalable way, implementing GraphQL Subscriptions, and designing GraphQL servers and clients for your application.",

Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, she studied math and computer science at Stanford University and then started at Facebook, where she’s worked for the last five years.

In her spare time, Laney enjoys running, baking, hiking, and traveling. Adam Kramer has been a software engineer at Facebook since 2008, working on the largest GraphQL server in the world for the last a year and a half.

We’ve moved from only valuing the opinions of senior developers to recognising the importance of contributions from people at all stages of learning. Learning itself has become a form of participating. These are examples of the sociolinguistic concepts of legitimation and positive welcoming.

It is often said that JavaScript makes things inaccessible with a screen reader. This is not true though. It is possible to do good and bad things with JavaScript (as with any other language, or even dynamite) - but it helps if you understand accessibility mechanics in the browser if you want to avoid unexpected consequences. If you have ever used JavaScript to provide keyboard shortcuts, or used the ARIA application role to enable accessible software UI interactions on the web, there is a good chance it had unintended consequences for screen reader users. Using code examples and screen reader demos, Léonie will look at accessibility mechanics in the browser, the new Accessibility Object Model (AOM) JavaScript API, and how to use JavaScript so you only blow the bloody doors off!",

Why is JavaScript's version of it the way it is? Prototype-oriented programming has been around for over 30 years now. From its earliest days as a series of language extensions for various languages, to the release of Self and the compiler technology it developed that's used by Chrome and Node.js, to the rise of JavaScript and beyond -- it has been an incredibly influential take on the concept of object-orientation, and withstood the test of time against its class-based counterparts. A Brief History of Prototypes will tell the story of this programming paradigm, the decisions and mistakes, the technological breakthroughs it led, its explosive rise in popularity on the back of ECMAScript, and puts it all in context with the way we use prototype-based languages today.",

While we as a community have started writing our UI's in terms of components, we are all still learning about the best way to write those components. What size should the components be? How much state should each component contain? This talk puts forth some best practices learned while building a reusable UI component library for an entire engineering team. And while the talk is specific to writing reusable UI components in React, the best practices and ways of thinking about components presented in this talk can be can be applied to components written in other frameworks as well.",
